I decided to make this to celebrate the 10th year anniversary of the beloved dino!
This is a prototype project developed by Pranav Mahajan.
Purpose of this bot is to play the dino easter egg in google chrome.
The screen res of my machine is 1366x768. Game will run offline on chrome.
Dimensions of game used are from: chrome:\\dino (It is maximized from mid to left)
You will have to adjust the globals "x_pad" & "y_pad" to adjust the program to your res
Have fun!
